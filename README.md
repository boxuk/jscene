jscene
======

JavaScript tutorial tool based on CodeMirror. Y'know, for kids!

Overview
--------

This app is a 100% JavaScript/HTML5 app that illustrates simple coding concepts
like functions, variables and loops by guiding the user through drawing a simple
scene in code.

It starts off with the user calling pre-made functions and gradually eases them
into uses Canvas directly.

It isn't a full-on tutorial, it's designed to give people a taster of coding.

More advanced users might be able to figure out how it's all done, and might even
unlock the secret code!

Libraries
=========

 * Twitter Bootstrap (of course!)
 * CodeMirror for code editing
 * jQuery for interactivity

Browser support
===============

Tested primarily in Chrome and IE9 and IE10.

Will not work in IE8 or below as it uses Canvas.
